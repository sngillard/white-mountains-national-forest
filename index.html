            <h2>Why hike the Whites?</h2>
            <h3>There are hundreds of mountains to explore!</h3>
            <p>
              The White Mountains National Forest, located in New Hampshire,
              USA, has hundreds of mountains to visit in a four seasons climite.
              It is home to the Presidential Range, a 20 mile traverse hike that
              takes you across seven 4,000-foot peaks, all named after U.S.
              presidents.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mount Washington is the tallest peak in the Northeastern United
              States at 6,288 feet and is notorious for having wild weather. The
              Franconia Ridge Loop, featuring Mount Lafayette, was named one of
              the best hikes in the World by National Geographic in 2017.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are also many smaller, more family-friendly hikes such as
              Mount Willard and the Welch-Dickey loop, which can be completed in
              an average of 2-4 hours and is featured in New Hampshire's "52
              with a view" list. This hike is not advised in wet weather due to
              the granite slabs you must traverse, but it offers amazing views
              with less effort and is undeniably goregous during the fall
              foliage season!
